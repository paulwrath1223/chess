## Chess notation
- Chess notation combines the chess piece moved with the new square it has moved to, on the chessboard.
- Chess notation uses abbreviations for each piece, using capitalized letters.
- King = K, Queen = Q, Bishop = B, Knight = N, Rook = R, Pawn = no notation.
- Capturing an enemy piece sees an “x” placed between the piece moved and the square the captured piece was upon.
- When the opponent’s king is threatened by check, a “+” sign is added to the end of the notation.
- Castling kingside is written as “0-0”. Castling queenside is notated with “0-0-0”


## Disambiguating moves
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)

When two (or more) identical pieces can move to the same square, the moving piece is uniquely identified by specifying the piece's letter, followed by (in descending order of preference):

the file of departure (if they differ); or
the rank of departure (if the files are the same but the ranks differ); or
both the file and rank of departure (if neither alone is sufficient to identify the piece – which occurs only in rare cases where a player has three or more identical pieces able to reach the same square, as a result of one or more pawns having promoted).
In the diagram, both black rooks could legally move to f8, so the move of the d8-rook to f8 is disambiguated as Rdf8. For the white rooks on the a-file which could both move to a3, it is necessary to provide the rank of the moving piece, i.e., R1a3.

In the case of the white queen on h4 moving to e1, neither the rank nor file alone are sufficient to disambiguate from the other white queens. As such, this move is written Qh4e1.

As above, an "x" can be inserted to indicate a capture; for example, if the final case were a capture, it would be written as Qh4xe1.
