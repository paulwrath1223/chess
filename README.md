## Chess notation
- Chess notation combines the chess piece moved with the new square it has moved to, on the chessboard.
- Chess notation uses abbreviations for each piece, using capitalized letters.
- King = K, Queen = Q, Bishop = B, Knight = N, Rook = R, Pawn = no notation.
- Capturing an enemy piece sees an “x” placed between the piece moved and the square the captured piece was upon.
- When the opponent’s king is threatened by check, a “+” sign is added to the end of the notation.
- Castling kingside is written as “0-0”. Castling queenside is notated with “0-0-0”
